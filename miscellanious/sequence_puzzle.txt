Challenge: "Missing Pattern"

A field report contains a suspicious sequence of numbers — the sender claims it's random, 
but you suspect a pattern. Use your reasoning skills to decode the hidden word and retrieve the flag.

File: sequence_puzzle.txt
Objective: Determine the hidden word from the sequence and present the flag in the format dalisec{WORD}

Sequence:
19, 5, 17, 21, 5, 14, 3, 5

Hints (optional):
1. Think simple mapping: A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26.
2. The sequence maps directly to letters.
3. The word is an English word often used to describe an order of things.

Example solver approach:
1. Map each number to a letter using A1Z26.
2. Join letters to form the hidden word.
3. Insert it into the flag format dalisec{WORD}

Good luck!
